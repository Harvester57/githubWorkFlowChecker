## Analysis

### Performance Characteristics

1. **Scaling with Repository Size**
   - Linear increase in memory usage with workflow count
   - Roughly linear increase in processing time
   - Consistent allocation patterns

2. **Concurrency Impact**
   - Optimal performance with 5 goroutines
   - Diminishing returns beyond 5 goroutines
   - Slight increase in memory overhead with more goroutines

3. **Memory Efficiency**
   - Consistent memory usage per workflow
   - No memory leaks detected
   - Efficient garbage collection

### Bottlenecks Identified

1. **File Processing**
   - Large repositories take significant time to process
   - Potential for optimization in YAML parsing
   - File I/O could be optimized

2. **Concurrency**
   - Thread contention beyond 5 goroutines
   - Coordination overhead increases with goroutine count
   - Room for improved work distribution

3. **Memory Usage**
   - High allocation count for large repositories
   - Potential for buffer reuse
   - YAML parsing memory overhead
