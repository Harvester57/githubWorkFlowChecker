# Product Context

## Purpose
The githubWorkFlowChecker is a Go-based tool designed to automatically manage and update GitHub Actions workflow dependencies across repositories. It serves as a custom alternative to Dependabot's action update functionality, providing more control and flexibility.

## Problems Solved
1. Manual dependency management of GitHub Actions versions
2. Risk of using outdated action versions
3. Time-consuming workflow maintenance
4. Lack of automated version checks
5. Need for consistent action version management across repositories

## How It Works
1. Scans repository workflow files (.github/workflows/*.yml)
2. Identifies GitHub Actions dependencies and their versions
3. Checks for newer versions of each action
4. Creates pull requests with version updates
5. Runs both as a CLI tool and a GitHub Action
6. Uses Alpine Linux for lightweight containerization
7. Self-updates its own workflow dependencies

## Key Features
1. Automated workflow scanning and version checking
2. Pull request creation for updates
3. CLI interface for manual runs
4. GitHub Action for automated runs
5. High test coverage (90%+)
6. Docker support with Alpine Linux
7. Makefile for common development tasks
